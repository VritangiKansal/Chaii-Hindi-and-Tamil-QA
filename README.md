Machine reading context and question answering is an indispensable task in Natural Language Processing. Recently(Sep 21) Google hosted a competition on Kaggle in which the task was to develop a model which can understand and comprehend context in Hindi and Tamil language give answers to asked questions in the respected language.


There are many models for context based question answering in English, but research on context based question answering hasn’t evolved that much, that’s the reason why we chose this competition as our AI project as we thought that this is a great initiative towards developing a natural language model for languages other than English.
